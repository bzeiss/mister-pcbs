# mister-pcbs

This site contains some stuff I have built for the excellent Miste project. You can more about the Mister project here: https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki

I tinker with electronics, release stuff when I feel like it and I make it public when it's not perfect. I'm not an electronics expert, so I may not always know what I'm doing. I learn the necessary electronics as I use it. Use at your own risk.

Be smart. Don't just trust the stuff I offer for download here. Take a look at the schematic and the PCB design beforehand. Feedback is very welcome :-)

## Midi PCB for Mister
Work in progress. Test PCBs have been ordered, don't use yet.
